   *   1. When `FT_Load_Glyph` needs to preset the glyphslot.
   *   2. Right before the `ot-svg` module calls the render callback hook.

   *   is the latter, the argument `cache` is set to `TRUE`. This distinction
   *   has been made because while presetting a glyphslot many calculations
   *   are needed and later the render callback hook needs the same
   *   calculations, thus, if `cache` is `TRUE`, the hook might _cache_ these
   *   calculations in `svg_renderer_state` of @FT_LibraryRec.

   *     A pointer to the SVG document.
   *
   *   svg_document_length ::
   *     The length of `svg_document`.
   *
   *   metrics ::
   *     A metrics object storing the size information.
   *
   *   units_per_EM ::
   *     The size of the EM square.
   *
   *   start_glyph_id ::
   *     The first glyph ID in the glyph range is covered by this document.

   *
   * @note:

   *   fields are stored in face object, but they are not; When the slot is
   *   passed down to a renderer, the renderer can only access the `metrics`
   *   and `units_per_EM` by `slot->face`. However, when `FT_Glyph_To_Bitmap`
   *   sets up a dummy object, it has no way to set a `face` object. Thus,
   *   metrics information and units_per_EM (which is necessary for OT-SVG)
   *   has to be stored separately.
